# Generating-Primes

My plan for the task is to first implement the sieve of Eratosthenes and then build upon it to make a segmented version of the sieve. This reduces the complexity of the algorithim allowing for the faster generation of prime numbers. The resulting primes will then be displayed to the user in a multiplication table.

Unfortunately I do not have experience with unit testing and after reading into it I feel I do not yet have the understanding of it to implement tests for this task given the time frame.
