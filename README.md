# Generating-Primes

My plan for the task is to first implement the sieve of Eratosthenes and then build upon it to make a segmented version of the sieve. This reduces the complexity of the algorithim allowing for the faster generation of prime numbers. The resulting primes will then be displayed to the user in a multiplication table.
